## Triangle-Architecture

Got idea from [Android Clean Architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture), this is a very simple Android app which describes how we can design a clean and clear architecture for an Android App. This example is using:

[Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection

[Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) for http requests

[DBFlow](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow) for saving objects to database

[Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) for unit testing

[RxJava and RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for simplify the business logic

In each layer also implement test
